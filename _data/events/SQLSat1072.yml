    <h2>A few highlights:</h2>
    <ul><li>Pre-pandemic SQL Saturday Atlanta drew in <strong>1,000+ registrations</strong> and had <strong>over 600 attendees</strong> in 2019. In 2022, we maxed out registration for a scaled down event at 350 registrations.</li>
    <li>This year we anticipate <strong>500+ attendees</strong> the day of the event. Our plan is to host ~70 sessions (12 tracks/6 sessions each) from the community, with <strong>4-5 sponsor sessions during lunch</strong>.</li>
    <li>To help guarantee sponsors get adequate leads for their investment, every registrant will be opted-in to communications from the event organizers and from sponsors. They will have the option of opting out post event via your email unsubscribe options.</li></ul>
    <h2>Sponsorship Benefits</h2>
    <p>Platinum sponsors come with options to customize your sponsorship benefits. In addition to a lunch session and priority selection on table location, the Platinum sponsor gets to choose 2** of the additional benefits listed below:</p>
    <ul><li>logo on speaker gift</li><li>advance email for registrants</li><li>post-event email to attendees</li><li>your name/logo to sponsor lunch or speaker dinner</li></ul>
    <p>These platinum benefits are awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis and availability at each sponsorship level is limited.</p>
    <p>Gold sponsorship benefits are customizable as well, ask how we can tailor the experience to suit your marketing needs.</p>
